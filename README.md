# This assessment sets out to observe four counties we identified as either gentrified/gentrifying or non-gentrified/slowly gentrifying (from most to least gentrified: Oakland, # # Kent, Muskegon, and Saginaw). We used data from the US Census and other various Michigan based .gov sites to make our observations.

# Our work shows Oakland and Kent to have higher average income, home values, rent costs, and rates of education, and lower infant mortality rates than Muskegon and Saginaw.
# There are many variables at play but generally speaking we saw our results reflect our initial prediction that counties perceived as more gentrified would be performing better by most fiscal measures.
